# Resources:
- I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

# Comments:
- Everything looks fine to me now using Atom on Windows 7. I have no idea why I couldn't get Atom plugins to work in Windows 10, which is what created the spacing errors in my last two assignments and provided me with no warnings that the discrepancies existed. I'll remain in Windows 7 for the rest of this class.
